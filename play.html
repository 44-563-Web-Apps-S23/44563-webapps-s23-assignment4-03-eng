<h6>TRADITION  _George Middleton_ </h6>
<p>OLLIVANT. [_Affectionately._] Glad to be home again, Mary?

    MARY. [_Evasively._] The garden is so pretty.<br>
    
    OLLIVANT. Hasn't changed much, eh?<br>
    
    MARY. It seems different; perhaps it's the night.<br>
    
    OLLIVANT. I guess it isn't up to its usual standard.<br>

     Haven't seen your mother there so often this spring.<br>
    
    EMILY. [_Quietly._] This dry spell is not good for flowers.<br>
    
    OLLIVANT. It's only the cultivated flowers that need care; can't help
    thinking that when I see the wild ones so hardy in my fields on the
    hill. [_Turning to_ EMILY _and patting her_.]<br> Is there any of that spray
    mixture left, Emily, dear?<br>
